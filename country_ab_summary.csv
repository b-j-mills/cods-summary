NOTE:  ABOUT THIS UPDATE. This administrative boundary structure was changed in August 2024 to insert a new administrative level between the previous administrative level 1 and level 2 boundaries. The previous level 2 boundaries have become level 3 boundaries. The general administrative structure is now 'departamento' (administrative level 1), 'municiplo' (level 2), and 'distrito' (level 3).
The former caveat about uninhabited administrative features being unrepresented in the COD-PS no longer applies.  The COD-PS now contains 'zero population' records for those features.

These administrative boundaries were established in:  2024

NOTE:  These layers have a special polygon structure. Administrative level 2 is actual islands, but level 1 (and level 0) is the surrounding administrative atolls or island groups (which in a few cases differ from distinct geographic atolls). Feature areas (AREA_SQKM) totals are therefore much larger for administrative level 1 (and 0). This COD-AB contains an extra """"""""Atoll Lines' layer that shows the island and atoll groupings. The administrative level 2 P-codes are derived from an earlier ('FCODE') system where available, and then completed alphabetically by name in other cases.

This COD-AB was most recently reviewed for accuracy and necessary changes in October 2024.  The COD-AB does not require any update.

Boundary information source:  State Scientific Production Enterprise “Kartographia”.  
Contributor:  OCHA Field Information Services Section (FISS).  
COD-AB quality level:  cod-enhanced (geometry and attributes verified and standardized).  
Most recent COD-AB review conclusion:  The COD-AB does not require any update.  
An edge-matched (COD-EM) dataset is available  
COD-EM HDX link:  https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-em-ukr.  
OCHA country status:  Operational (country office).  
Most recent COD-AB review date:  January 2025.  
Deepest administrative level:  ADM4.  
COD-PS HDX URL:  https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ps-ukr.  
Deepest administrative level with complete coverage:  ADM3.  
Administrative level required by humanitarian community:  ADM2.  
Note:  The Ukrainian government has not fully implemented its new administrative structure reforms in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea [UA01] and Sevastopol [UA85].  
Consequently, 31 ADM4 features within the Sevastopol ADM3 polygon retain P-codes that do not correctly conform to [UA85]. This will be rectified in a COD-AB update once the government has regained control of the Crimean Peninsula.  
Note:  Some administrative feature names were adjusted in a September/October 2024 administratrive feature renaming exercise.  See reference table at https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-ukr.  
Note:  The Ukraine COD-AB was most recently adjusted in early 2024 - affecting administrative level 3 (hromadas) only.  
Note:  The population statistics common operational dataset (COD-PS-UKR) is only available via special request.  See [Ukraine - Subnational Population Statistics](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ps-ukr).  Users should use the 'Request Data' button.  
Note:  Limitations of the Ukrainian-to-Russian transliteration method mean that more than one Ukrainian name may be represented by a single Russian feature name.  
Note:  Feature name attribute fields in this dataset incorrectly use 'UA' to represent the Ukrainian language.  The correct language code is 'UK'.  This will be resolved in 2026.  
Note:  ADM0 is not affected by the September/October 2024 administrative feature renaming exercise.  
Typical feature type:  oblast (region) with three exceptions.  
P-code format:  UAnn.  
COD-PS compatibility:  ADM0, ADM1, ADM2.  
OCHA region:  Europe.  
Feature count:  27.  
The ADM1 layer can be linked by P-CODE to the ADM1 Population statistics.  
Note:  Kyiv (city) [UA80] and Sevastopol [UA85] are each a 'city with special status' rather than an 'oblast'.  
Note:  Crimea [UA01] is an 'autonomous republic' rather than an 'oblast'.  
Note:  However, Ukraine Population Statistics are only available on special request.  

ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL 4 metadata:
Typical feature type:  ADM4 features may be of 'city', 'settlement', or 'village' type.  However, all 'village' features are currently categorized in the 'ADM4_TYPE' as a 'settlement'.  This is expected to be resolved in 2026.  
P-code format:  UAnnnnnnnnnn.  
Feature count:  29707.  
COD-PS compatibility:  no ADM4 population statistics are available.  
COD-PS HDX URL:  https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ps-ukr.  
Note:  329 ADM4 features were affected by the September/October 2024 administrative feature renaming excercise.  
Specific details are provided in the 'ADM4' tab of the 'UKR_Admin234_Renaming_ReferenceTable_20250123.xlsx' reference table available on the HDX dataset [Ukraine - Subnational Administrative Boundaries](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-ukr).  
Note:  The COD-AB ADM4 boundary attributes for this COD-AB have not been adjusted.  
The Ukrainian government has not fully implemented its new administrative structure reforms in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea [UA01] and Sevastopol [UA85].  
Consequently, 31 ADM4 features within the Sevastopol ADM3 polygon retain P-codes that do not correctly conform to [UA85].  This will be rectified in a COD-AB update once the government has regained control of the Crimean Peninsula.  ",27,139,1769,29707
