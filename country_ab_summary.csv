NOTE:  ABOUT THIS UPDATE. This administrative boundary structure was changed in August 2024 to insert a new administrative level between the previous administrative level 1 and level 2 boundaries. The previous level 2 boundaries have become level 3 boundaries. The general administrative structure is now 'departamento' (administrative level 1), 'municiplo' (level 2), and 'distrito' (level 3).
The former caveat about uninhabited administrative features being unrepresented in the COD-PS no longer applies.  The COD-PS now contains 'zero population' records for those features.

This COD-AB was most recently reviewed for accuracy and necessary changes in August 2024.  The COD-AB requires improvements.

The shapefile, geodatabase, and EMF layers sourced from Le Haut Commissariat au Plan data (HCP) have been vetted and configured by ITOS.   Topological errors have been fixed and the lines layer is now available.  The live geoservices are currently those provided before the September 2023 earthquake, but will be updated shortly.

NOTE ABOUT P-CODES.  The _Haut Commissariat au Plan data (HCP)_ source data contained place codes that did not reference administrative level 1 (regions).  To maintain consistency with the previous COD-AB - as well as the live geoservices that are currently in place - the new layers maintain the P-coding at administrative levels 1 and 2 and then append the HCP place coding for administrative levels 3 and 4.



SEPTEMBER 15 2023 UPDATE
The administrative level 0-4 gazetteer spreadsheet and geodatabase is now available.
The large number of topology errors prohibits creation of a lines layer until they can be corrected.

This dataset now contains a preliminary set of administrative level 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 shapefiles recently derived from Le Haut Commissariat au Plan data (HCP).  Administrative level 0, 1, and 2 P-codes match those in the other layers - and live geoservices - contained in this dataset.  Administrative level 3 and 4 P-codes are derived from the HCP layers.

These new layers are more detailed than the previous layers but contain topological errors.
