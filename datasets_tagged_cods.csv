This data is provided in an effort to promote the use of geospatial science and applications for sustainable development and resource conservation in the developing world. Digital elevation models (DEM) for the entire globe, covering all of the countries of the world, are available for download on this site.

The SRTM 90m DEMs have a resolution of 90m at the equator, and are provided in mosaiced 5 deg x 5 deg tiles for easy download and use. All are produced from a seamless dataset to allow easy mosaicing. These are available in both ArcInfo ASCII and GeoTiff format to facilitate their ease of use in a variety of image processing and GIS applications. Data can be downloaded using a browser or accessed directly from the ftp site. If you find this digital elevation data useful, please let us know atÂ [csi@cgiar.org](mailto:csi@cgiar.org).

The NASA Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) has provided digital elevation data (DEMs) for over 80% of the globe. This data is currently distributed free of charge by USGS and is available for download from the National Map Seamless Data Distribution System, or the USGS ftp site. The SRTM data is available as 3 arc second (approx. 90m resolution) DEMs. A 1 arc second data product was also produced, but is not available for all countries. The vertical error of the DEMâ€™s is reported to be less than 16m. The data currently being distributed by NASA/USGS (finished product) contains â€œno-dataâ€ holes where water or heavy shadow prevented the quantification of elevation. These are generally small holes, which nevertheless render the data less useful, especially in fields of hydrological modeling.

original DEMs were further processed to fill in these no-data voids. This involved the production of vector contours and points, and the re-interpolation of these derived contours back into a raster DEM. These interpolated DEM values are then used to fill in the original no-data holes within the SRTM data. These processes were implemented using Arc/Info and an AML script. The DEM files have been mosaiced into a seamless near-global coverage (up to 60 degrees north and south), and are available for download as 5 degree x 5 degree tiles, in geographic coordinate system â€“ WGS84 datum. These files are available for download in both Arc-Info ASCII format, and as GeoTiff, for easy use in most GIS and Remote Sensing software appications. In addition, a binary Data Mask file is available for download, allowing users to identify the areas within each DEM which has been interpolated.

With this village update the SIGCAF dataset was compared to a village dataset available from World Resources Institute, 2013 ([http://www.wri.org/resources/maps/forest-atlas-central-african-republic](http://www.wri.org/resources/maps/forest-atlas-central-african-republic)).

The two datasets were combined and the checked for duplicates in the following steps:

1. Elininate all villages with the same geo-location and the same name, autmatically with the ""Find Duplicates"" option in the ArcToolb

2. Manual check, commune by commune for duplciate villages between the two datasets.

3. Generated new pcodes, keeping the old pcode for consistency, and using the pcodes of region, prefecture, sub-prefecture, commune.

4. Updates from the field added


The first 4 characters correspond to the commune pcode, and the next 4 are a unique village identifier


The dataset has been updated (24 March 2014) .  

","**Most Recent Changes:** 21-02-2014 - This is an update of the village dataset, by combining and comparing the SIGCAF dataset with the WRI dataset.


15-01-2015  - This is an update of the villages dataset that was registered (CAF_Settlements-SIGCAF.shp)  It contains updates on villages, based on feedback from OCHA field staff. Also includes an excel sheet list of all the villages with pcodes.

The MoES published these administrative boundaries online and made publicly available.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for Caucasus and Central Asia with support from OCHA FIS cleaned the administrative level 3 dataset, integrated P-codes according to the State Classification of Administrative and Territorial Units (COATE) of the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018, names in 3 languages (English, Kyrgyz, Russian) and place types.  Twelve independent cities (from the same source but a different dataset) were added to the administrative level 3 dataset to ensure it fully corresponds to the COATE. 

ITOS live services will be added at a later date.

The Kyrgyz administrative boundary system does not designate administrative level 3 (community) features outside administrative level urban areas although those areas are characterized by rural type.  This administrative level 3 shapefile and KMZ file includes ‘expanded’ units with special P-code suffixes which characterize the features according to an OCHA developed coding system.  For instance, the Forestry in Uzgen district (KG06255000000) has a Pcode of KG06255000901. 

Some source polygons were indicated as ‘Unknown’ and are designated as such in the gazetteer.

The gazetteer contains the standard administrative level 3 table and an 'expanded' administrative level 3 table.

The ‘expanded’ administrative level 3 P-code suffix system is described below:
ADM3_PCODE suffix	ADM3Type_EN	ADM3Type_RU	ADM3Type_KY

901	Forestry	Лесхоз	Токой чарба

902	Government reserved land	Госземзапас	Мамлекеттик жер запасы

903	Lake	Озеро	Көл

904	National park	Национальный парк	Улуттук парк

…	…	…	…

921	Unknown	Неизвестно	Белгисиз

The administrative level 2 (district) shapefile and KMZ file contain 'placeholder' polygons corresponding to the administrative level 1 independent city features that the Kyrgyz administrative boundary system does not recognize at administrative level 2.

These eight- or nine-digit codes begin with one or two digits that correspond to the quarters (administrative level 1 features) and then seven digits with no discernible significance.

Castries features have ‘1’, ‘2’, or ‘3’ prefixes that form non-geographically contiguous groups. As the names and significance of these groups are unknown, the Castries features were given a common and nationally distinct ‘13’ prefix in the OCHA P-code system. To preserve the ‘1’, ‘2’, and ‘3’ designations, to provide a distinct formulation for all of Castries features, and to maintain the source settlement codes the OHCA P-code system comprises the national code (‘LC’), the new prefixes (‘4’ to ‘13’) and the original settlement codes (padded to nine digits).

The source dataset had two administrative level 2 features, ‘Petit Piton’ and ‘Ti Delcer’ in Soufriere quarter with the same ‘settlement code’ (60720000). These have been given the distinct P-codes LC06060720001 and LC06060720002 respectively.

Some other sources (such as www.citypopulation.de) distinguish the ‘Central Forest Reserve’ (LC11110450000) as a distinct quarter but this is not supported by its settlement code.

These two are included on HDX in other datasets, for example on the population statistics and humanitarian profile, and in the gazetteer provided with this dataset.",administrative divisions | common operational dataset - cod | gazetteer,geoservice | shp | xlsx | geodatabase

Most administrative level 2 (district) features contain one or more complete zones de santé (health zones), thus enabling summation of the contained zone de santé populations.  For instance, the 2019 population for ‘Matadi’ (CD2001) is summed from the populations of zone de santé Matadi (zone de santé code CD2001ZS01) and Nzanza (CD2001ZS02).

However, the following 25 small urban level 2 features are contained in larger level 2 features that are not distinctly represented by a zones de santé.  The “cod_admpop_adm2” tab of the population spreadsheet indicates zero populations for those features and the table below identifies the level 2 feature that includes the missing population.  (Three level 2 features include the missing population from two features each.)

This situation has no impact on the administrative level 1 (province) tables as every zone de santé lies completely in a level 1 feature.

Source: The dataset was compiled from three sources:

- DIVA: U.S. National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA) database of foreign geographic feature names as of in June 2012 - 12,215 locations.
- DTM (Displacement Tracking Matrix) master lists of IDP and returnee locations as of April 2020 - 2,054 locations.
- OSM (Open Street Maps) - 23,541 locations.

Method:
1)	Datasets were merged and duplicate locations were identified and excluded based on spatial proximity and common name attributes. The final dataset consisted of 12,494 locations. 
2)	An ArcGIS spatial join routine was used to attribute locations with the administrative boundary names and place codes for governorates, districts, and sub-districts. Attributes were also applied for the administrative centers of governorates and districts. 
3)	The population density (people per hectare) at each location was extracted from the WorldPop 2020 estimate (grid format) using the Extract by Points routine in ArcGIS (point overlay). https://www.worldpop.org/doi/10.5258/SOTON/WP00117","- This dataset is to be used for humanitarian purposes only.
- It is intended to be a gazetteer for geographical reference and should not be used as a cartographic source or as an authoritative reference list. 
- The dataset does NOT contain any designations of hierarchy (e.g. governorate or district capitals), and as such, the placenames may refer to a variety of place type, including city, town, village or neighbourhood.

Built-up areas (BUAs):  A built-up area (BUA) is generally an area of urbanisation with moderately-to-densely-spaced buildings and a visible grid of streets and blocks. BUAs are characterized as polygons that maintain a 100 m2 building density of 13 or more across an area greater than or equal to 0.4 km2.

Small Settlements (SSAs): A small settlement (SSA) is a settled area of permanently inhabited structures and compounds of roughly a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants. The housing pattern in SSAs is an assemblage of family compounds adjoining other similar habitations. SSAs areas are characterised as polygons containing 50 or more buildings and not a BUA.

Hamlet  (HAMLET): A hamlet is a collection of several compounds or sleeping houses in isolation from small settlements or urban areas. Hamlets are characterised as polygons containing between 1 and 49 buildings.

 Built-up areas (BUAs):  A built-up area (BUA) is generally an area of urbanisation with moderately-to-densely-spaced buildings and a visible grid of streets and blocks. BUAs are characterized as polygons that maintain a 100 m2 building density of 13 or more across an area greater than or equal to 0.4 km2.

Small Settlements (SSAs): A small settlement (SSA) is a settled area of permanently inhabited structures and compounds of roughly a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants. The housing pattern in SSAs is an assemblage of family compounds adjoining other similar habitations. SSAs areas are characterised as polygons containing 50 or more buildings and not a BUA.

 Hamlet  (HAMLET): A hamlet is a collection of several compounds or sleeping houses in isolation from small settlements or urban areas. Hamlets are characterised as polygons containing between 1 and 49 buildings.

The GRID3 Réunion settlement extents are then classified (based on building density) into three classes: built-up areas (BUA), small settlement areas (SSA), and Hamlets (Barau et al., 2014). These three classes of settlement agglomerations are presented below:  

 Built-up areas (BUAs):  A built-up area (BUA) is generally an area of urbanisation with moderately-to-densely-spaced buildings and a visible grid of streets and blocks. BUAs are characterized as polygons that maintain a 100 m2 building density of 13 or more across an area greater than or equal to 0.4 km2.

Small Settlements (SSAs): A small settlement (SSA) is a settled area of permanently inhabited structures and compounds of roughly a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants. The housing pattern in SSAs is an assemblage of family compounds adjoining other similar habitations. SSAs areas are characterised as polygons containing 50 or more buildings and not a BUA.

 Hamlet  (HAMLET): A hamlet is a collection of several compounds or sleeping houses in isolation from small settlements or urban areas. Hamlets are characterised as polygons containing between 1 and 49 buildings.

 Built-up areas (BUAs):  A built-up area (BUA) is generally an area of urbanisation with moderately-to-densely-spaced buildings and a visible grid of streets and blocks. BUAs are characterized as polygons that maintain a 100 m2 building density of 13 or more across an area greater than or equal to 0.4 km2.

Small Settlements (SSAs): A small settlement (SSA) is a settled area of permanently inhabited structures and compounds of roughly a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants. The housing pattern in SSAs is an assemblage of family compounds adjoining other similar habitations. SSAs areas are characterised as polygons containing 50 or more buildings and not a BUA.

 Hamlet  (HAMLET): A hamlet is a collection of several compounds or sleeping houses in isolation from small settlements or urban areas. Hamlets are characterised as polygons containing between 1 and 49 buildings.

Feature [UA32] is Kyiv oblast.

A major limitation of this COD-PS is its reliance on a population census conducted more than 20 years ago, namely the 2001 population and housing census of Ukraine. 

The 2001 census in Ukraine was subject to severe undercount in all oblasts — with an average undercount of 10.5%. This undercount was more severe in large urban areas (e.g. Kyiv City, Kharkiv, Sevastopol and Dnipropetrovsk). No sex differential was observed in the 2001 census undercount. Raw census data have been adjusted for undercount in the census, along with updated birth and death registration data, prior to the projection of the population forward from 2001 to 2020. The census undercount was concentrated in the age group 0-4 years and ranged from 7% in Transcarpathia to 15% in Sevastopol and Kharkiv and 16% in Kyiv. 

UNFPA has assessed population age-/sex-specific projections against available household survey data (namely the 2014 Household Budget Survey, 2012 MICS Survey, 2007 DHS Survey and 2009-2014 Labor Force Survey). These ADM-1 population projections are consistent with the fertility and mortality trends documented in the available survey data. The vital registration data and ADM-1 population projections for 2020 do not exhibit any notable age heaping.

Birth and death registration in Ukraine is mandatory. The vital registration system in Ukraine between 2001 and 2020 appears to have been well-maintained. The birth and death registration data is approximately complete in Ukraine for this time period in areas that have been under effective control of the government of Ukraine. Since 2014, the completeness and quality of vital event registration in Donetsk and Luhansk has detioriated.

A limitation of the vital registration data in Ukraine is that these data are published by place of registration, not by place of occurrence (and place of registration). As a result, the 2020 population projections using 2001 census data and 2001-2019 vital registration data implicitly assume that there is negligible difference between the place where births and deaths occur and where they are registered. While this is likely true in most urban areas of Ukraine, it is unlikely for the more rural areas of Ukraine where people seek health care (both reproductive care, emergency care and chronic disease care) in urban areas. As a result, this COD-PS is likely to under-estimate the older age population size in rural areas of Ukraine and over estimate the young age population size in urban areas. 

This COD-PS assumes that internal migration between oblasts and international migration after the 2001 census are accurately reflected in administrative data on migration flows maintained by the State Statistics Service of Ukraine. Further refinement of the COD-PS is likely needed to account for recent migration movements related to armed conflict. So, where possible, this COD-PS dataset should be integrated with available data on migration stocks and flows from UNHCR, IOM, and other sources.",baseline population | common operational dataset - cod,csv | xlsx

This COD-PS is constructed directly from post-censal population estimates from the 2021 Population, Housing and Dwelling Census of Slovakia. The 2021 census was the first 100% electronic census and the first integrated census (combination of data obtained from administrative sources and data obtained from the population). It was conducted as a ""de jure"" census. For the population census, the information was collected either through the census website (scitanie.sk) or via a mobile app (SODB2021) which was available both on Android and iOS. The census form was available in 8 languages (Slovak, Hungarian, Romani, Russian, Ukrainian, English, German, French) and came in two types.
The ""Type A"" form allowed respondents to register by birth number or identity card or residence permit. The census form only collected data that could not be obtained in the required quality from existing administrative sources, so there were fewer questions compared to previous censuses, thus reducing the administrative burden on the population.
The ""Type B"" form allowed respondents to register by date of birth and sex, as it was primarily intended for residents who do not have an assigned personal identification number in Slovakia. The type B census contained more questions (20 questions) than the type A form (14 questions), as it is not possible to use administrative data sources for residents without a birth or registration number.

The GRID3 Senegal settlement extents are then classified (based on building density) into three classes: built-up areas (BUA), small settlement areas (SSA), and Hamlets (Barau et al., 2014). These three classes of settlement agglomerations are presented below:  

 Built-up areas (BUAs):  A built-up area (BUA) is generally an area of urbanisation with moderately-to-densely-spaced buildings and a visible grid of streets and blocks. BUAs are characterized as polygons that maintain a 100 m2 building density of 13 or more across an area greater than or equal to 0.4 km2.

Small Settlements (SSAs): A small settlement (SSA) is a settled area of permanently inhabited structures and compounds of roughly a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants. The housing pattern in SSAs is an assemblage of family compounds adjoining other similar habitations. SSAs areas are characterised as polygons containing 50 or more buildings and not a BUA.

 Hamlet  (HAMLET): A hamlet is a collection of several compounds or sleeping houses in isolation from small settlements or urban areas. Hamlets are characterised as polygons containing between 1 and 49 buildings.
