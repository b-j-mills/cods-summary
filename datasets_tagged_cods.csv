Castries features have ‚Äò1‚Äô, ‚Äò2‚Äô, or ‚Äò3‚Äô prefixes that form non-geographically contiguous groups. As the names and significance of these groups are unknown, the Castries features were given a common and nationally distinct ‚Äò13‚Äô prefix in the OCHA P-code system. To preserve the ‚Äò1‚Äô, ‚Äò2‚Äô, and ‚Äò3‚Äô designations, to provide a distinct formulation for all of Castries features, and to maintain the source settlement codes the OHCA P-code system comprises the national code (‚ÄòLC‚Äô), the new prefixes (‚Äò4‚Äô to ‚Äò13‚Äô) and the original settlement codes (padded to nine digits).

Most administrative level 2 (district) features contain one or more complete zones de sant√© (health zones), thus enabling summation of the contained zone de sant√© populations.  For instance, the 2019 population for ‚ÄòMatadi‚Äô (CD2001) is summed from the populations of zone de sant√© Matadi (zone de sant√© code CD2001ZS01) and Nzanza (CD2001ZS02).

However, the following 25 small urban level 2 features are contained in larger level 2 features that are not distinctly represented by a zones de sant√©.  The ‚Äúcod_admpop_adm2‚Äù tab of the population spreadsheet indicates zero populations for those features and the table below identifies the level 2 feature that includes the missing population.  (Three level 2 features include the missing population from two features each.)

This situation has no impact on the administrative level 1 (province) tables as every zone de sant√© lies completely in a level 1 feature.

Administrative level 1:  11 regional states (kililoch, singular kilil‚Äâ) and two chartered cities (astedader akababiwoch, singular astedader akababi‚Äâ), - Addis Ababa [ET14] and Dire Dawa [ET15].

Administrative level 2:  92 zones

Administrative level 3:  1,084 woredas (see caveats)

The 2022 population estimate is based on the 2021 Central Statistics Agency (CSA) projection at administrative level 3 and CSA‚Äôs town populations.  For the newly split woredas, which are mainly towns upgraded to woredas, the CSA town population is adjusted according to the parent woreda‚Äôs population.  For woredas in the HNO 2022 administrative list, having no population data estimate in either CSA 2021 projection of woreda or towns, the 2021 HNO estimate is used.

For newly created woredas, in the absence of estimates in the 2021 CSA projection of woreda population or town population, and the absence of information on the HNO2021 estimates, appropriate average populations are used from the parent woreda population (e.g., Arda Jila woreda in Oromiya region; Tulefa town, Gashena town, Tulu Awila and Adagn Ager Chaqo in Amharta region).  The final population estimate is then adjusted against the new CSA 2021 total projections at administrative level 1.

The new CSA 2021 population estimate includes disaggregation by sex, which is considered in this estimation. However, for urban and rural population estimates, as there is no such estimation in the newly CSA 2021 projection, the 2017 CSA projection proportion is applied at administrative level 3. Similarly, the age breakdown is estimated based on the CSA 2016 Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey (HCES) available at administrative level 1.

The age groups from CSA 2016 HCES include the age groups 0-9 and 15-19 years.  To support humanitarian needs analysis and response planning for specific children age groups, the age group 0-9 has been split into two (0-4 and 5-9) and the 15-19 age group has been split into two (15-17 and 18-19) using the Federal Ministry of Health's estimated population distribution for the particular age groups.

Finally, the estimated values were rounded to whole integers and therefore introduce minute difference in totals for the consolidated administrative level 2, 1, and 0 tables.  (The maximum national deviation for total population is 6.)
","Two administrative level 3 units are not represented in the COD-AB because of their contested boundaries:  Dawe Serer [ET041199] in Oromia region and Quarsadula [ET050905] in Somali region.   These features are included in the 'eth_gazetteer_20201102.xlsx' but excluded from the reference ITOS 'ETH_AdminBoundaries_TabularData.xlsx' gazetteer.

The MoES published these administrative boundaries online and made publicly available.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for Caucasus and Central Asia with support from OCHA FIS cleaned the administrative level 3 dataset, integrated P-codes according to the State Classification of Administrative and Territorial Units (COATE) of the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018, names in 3 languages (English, Kyrgyz, Russian) and place types.  Twelve independent cities (from the same source but a different dataset) were added to the administrative level 3 dataset to ensure it fully corresponds to the COATE. 

ITOS live services will be added at a later date.

The Kyrgyz administrative boundary system does not designate administrative level 3 (community) features outside administrative level urban areas although those areas are characterized by rural type.  This administrative level 3 shapefile and KMZ file includes ‚Äòexpanded‚Äô units with special P-code suffixes which characterize the features according to an OCHA developed coding system.  For instance, the Forestry in Uzgen district (KG06255000000) has a Pcode of KG06255000901. 

Some source polygons were indicated as ‚ÄòUnknown‚Äô and are designated as such in the gazetteer.

The gazetteer contains the standard administrative level 3 table and an 'expanded' administrative level 3 table.

The ‚Äòexpanded‚Äô administrative level 3 P-code suffix system is described below:

The COD-AB consolidates the following sub-metropolitan areas found in this COD-PS dataset:

""KMA-Bantama"", ""KMA-Manhyia"", ""KMA-Manhyia South"", ""KMA-Nhyiaeso"", and ""KMA-Subin"" are consolidated into ""Kumasi Metropolitan"" [GH0228]
""CCMA-Cape Coast North"" and ""CCMA-Cape Coast South"" are consolidated into Coast Metropolitan [GH0511]
""AMA-Ablekuma South"", ""AMA-Ashiedu Keteke"", and ""AMA-Okaikoi South"" are consolidated into ""Accra Metropolis"" [GH0704]
""TMA-Tema Central"" and ""TMA-Tema East"" are consolidated into ""Tema Metropolitan"" [GH0727]
""TMA-Tamale Central"" and ""TMA-Tamale South"" are consolidated into ""Tamale Metropolitan"" [GH0812]
""STMA-Essikado-Ketan"", ""STMA-Sekondi"", and ""STMA-Takoradi"" are consolidated into ""Sekondi Takoradi Metropolis"" [GH1508]

The COD-AB excludes Guan district (census population 28,238) which was created in 2021 from Hohoe district [GH1410].  However, although Hohoe district is in Volta region [GH14], Guan was made a part of an enlarged Oti region [GH10].  

The gha_admpop_2022.xlsx spreadsheet and associated .csv files handle the above discrepancies in the folllowing manner:

1)  The spreadsheet includes the following tabs:

The complete census population data is found in the 'gha_admpop_adm2PS_2022' tab (272 data records) including the following fields:
'ADM2_PCODE' from the COD-AB, containing duplicates in the case of consolidations detailed above;
'ADM2_EN_PS' containing the census source district names;
'ADM2_EN' containing the corresponding COD-AB district name field with duplicates for the metropolitain consolidations names detailed above above and 'Hohoe' instead of 'Guan'.
This table is not represented by a .csv file.

2)  The census population data aligned to the COD-AB administrative level 2 layer is found in the 'gha_admpop_adm2_2022' tab (260 data records).   This table is also represented in the 'gha_admpop_adm2_2022.csv' file.

3)  The census population data aligned to the COD-AB administrative level 1 layer is found in the 'gha_admpop_adm1_2022' tab (16 data records).  This table assigns the population of Guan district to the Oti region record even though Guan district was created from the Volta region.  In this way the Oti and Volta polygons may be mapped with their census populations although the COD-AB is thought to have become slightly incorrect.  This table is also represented in the 'gha_admpop_adm1_2022.csv' file.

The 'gha_admpop_adm0_2022' tab and 'gha_admpop_adm0_2022.csv' file are not influenced by these caveats.

This COD-PS is constructed directly from post-censal population estimates from the 2021 Population, Housing and Dwelling Census of Slovakia. The 2021 census was the first 100% electronic census and the first integrated census (combination of data obtained from administrative sources and data obtained from the population). It was conducted as a ""de jure"" census. For the population census, the information was collected either through the census website (scitanie.sk) or via a mobile app (SODB2021) which was available both on Android and iOS. The census form was available in 8 languages (Slovak, Hungarian, Romani, Russian, Ukrainian, English, German, French) and came in two types.
The ""Type A"" form allowed respondents to register by birth number or identity card or residence permit. The census form only collected data that could not be obtained in the required quality from existing administrative sources, so there were fewer questions compared to previous censuses, thus reducing the administrative burden on the population.
The ""Type B"" form allowed respondents to register by date of birth and sex, as it was primarily intended for residents who do not have an assigned personal identification number in Slovakia. The type B census contained more questions (20 questions) than the type A form (14 questions), as it is not possible to use administrative data sources for residents without a birth or registration number.
