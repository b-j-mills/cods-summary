Moreover, a large part of the Belgut and Konoin Admin2 units were overlapping.  The issue was resolved using https://softkenya.com/kenya/belgut-constituency/ as a reference.

This data is provided in an effort to promote the use of geospatial science and applications for sustainable development and resource conservation in the developing world. Digital elevation models (DEM) for the entire globe, covering all of the countries of the world, are available for download on this site.

The SRTM 90m DEMs have a resolution of 90m at the equator, and are provided in mosaiced 5 deg x 5 deg tiles for easy download and use. All are produced from a seamless dataset to allow easy mosaicing. These are available in both ArcInfo ASCII and GeoTiff format to facilitate their ease of use in a variety of image processing and GIS applications. Data can be downloaded using a browser or accessed directly from the ftp site. If you find this digital elevation data useful, please let us know atÂ [csi@cgiar.org](mailto:csi@cgiar.org).

The NASA Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) has provided digital elevation data (DEMs) for over 80% of the globe. This data is currently distributed free of charge by USGS and is available for download from the National Map Seamless Data Distribution System, or the USGS ftp site. The SRTM data is available as 3 arc second (approx. 90m resolution) DEMs. A 1 arc second data product was also produced, but is not available for all countries. The vertical error of the DEMâ€™s is reported to be less than 16m. The data currently being distributed by NASA/USGS (finished product) contains â€œno-dataâ€ holes where water or heavy shadow prevented the quantification of elevation. These are generally small holes, which nevertheless render the data less useful, especially in fields of hydrological modeling.

original DEMs were further processed to fill in these no-data voids. This involved the production of vector contours and points, and the re-interpolation of these derived contours back into a raster DEM. These interpolated DEM values are then used to fill in the original no-data holes within the SRTM data. These processes were implemented using Arc/Info and an AML script. The DEM files have been mosaiced into a seamless near-global coverage (up to 60 degrees north and south), and are available for download as 5 degree x 5 degree tiles, in geographic coordinate system â€“ WGS84 datum. These files are available for download in both Arc-Info ASCII format, and as GeoTiff, for easy use in most GIS and Remote Sensing software appications. In addition, a binary Data Mask file is available for download, allowing users to identify the areas within each DEM which has been interpolated.

The MoES published these administrative boundaries online and made publicly available.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for Caucasus and Central Asia with support from OCHA FIS cleaned the administrative level 3 dataset, integrated P-codes according to the State Classification of Administrative and Territorial Units (COATE) of the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018, names in 3 languages (English, Kyrgyz, Russian) and place types.  Twelve independent cities (from the same source but a different dataset) were added to the administrative level 3 dataset to ensure it fully corresponds to the COATE. 

ITOS live services will be added at a later date.

The Kyrgyz administrative boundary system does not designate administrative level 3 (community) features outside administrative level urban areas although those areas are characterized by rural type.  This administrative level 3 shapefile and KMZ file includes ‘expanded’ units with special P-code suffixes which characterize the features according to an OCHA developed coding system.  For instance, the Forestry in Uzgen district (KG06255000000) has a Pcode of KG06255000901. 

Some source polygons were indicated as ‘Unknown’ and are designated as such in the gazetteer.

The gazetteer contains the standard administrative level 3 table and an 'expanded' administrative level 3 table.

The ‘expanded’ administrative level 3 P-code suffix system is described below:
ADM3_PCODE suffix	ADM3Type_EN	ADM3Type_RU	ADM3Type_KY

901	Forestry	Лесхоз	Токой чарба

902	Government reserved land	Госземзапас	Мамлекеттик жер запасы

The administrative level 2 (district) shapefile and KMZ file contain 'placeholder' polygons corresponding to the administrative level 1 independent city features that the Kyrgyz administrative boundary system does not recognize at administrative level 2.

Similarly the administrative level 3 (community) shapefile and KMZ file contains 'placeholder' polygons for the  administrative level 1 and administrative level 2 features that the Kyrgyz administrative boundary system does not recognize at administrative level 3.","Community Users should be aware that 277 Admin3 names are blank.

Most administrative level 2 (district) features contain one or more complete zones de santé (health zones), thus enabling summation of the contained zone de santé populations.  For instance, the 2019 population for ‘Matadi’ (CD2001) is summed from the populations of zone de santé Matadi (zone de santé code CD2001ZS01) and Nzanza (CD2001ZS02).

However, the following 25 small urban level 2 features are contained in larger level 2 features that are not distinctly represented by a zones de santé.  The “cod_admpop_adm2” tab of the population spreadsheet indicates zero populations for those features and the table below identifies the level 2 feature that includes the missing population.  (Three level 2 features include the missing population from two features each.)

This situation has no impact on the administrative level 1 (province) tables as every zone de santé lies completely in a level 1 feature.

Built-up areas (BUAs):  A built-up area (BUA) is generally an area of urbanisation with moderately-to-densely-spaced buildings and a visible grid of streets and blocks. BUAs are characterized as polygons that maintain a 100 m2 building density of 13 or more across an area greater than or equal to 0.4 km2.

Small Settlements (SSAs): A small settlement (SSA) is a settled area of permanently inhabited structures and compounds of roughly a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants. The housing pattern in SSAs is an assemblage of family compounds adjoining other similar habitations. SSAs areas are characterised as polygons containing 50 or more buildings and not a BUA.

Hamlet  (HAMLET): A hamlet is a collection of several compounds or sleeping houses in isolation from small settlements or urban areas. Hamlets are characterised as polygons containing between 1 and 49 buildings.

The GRID3 Ghana settlement extents are then classified (based on building density) into three classes: built-up areas (BUA), small settlement areas (SSA), and Hamlets (Barau et al., 2014). These three classes of settlement agglomerations are presented below:  

 Built-up areas (BUAs):  A built-up area (BUA) is generally an area of urbanisation with moderately-to-densely-spaced buildings and a visible grid of streets and blocks. BUAs are characterized as polygons that maintain a 100 m2 building density of 13 or more across an area greater than or equal to 0.4 km2.

Small Settlements (SSAs): A small settlement (SSA) is a settled area of permanently inhabited structures and compounds of roughly a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants. The housing pattern in SSAs is an assemblage of family compounds adjoining other similar habitations. SSAs areas are characterised as polygons containing 50 or more buildings and not a BUA.

 Hamlet  (HAMLET): A hamlet is a collection of several compounds or sleeping houses in isolation from small settlements or urban areas. Hamlets are characterised as polygons containing between 1 and 49 buildings.

The GRID3 Mauritius settlement extents are then classified (based on building density) into three classes: built-up areas (BUA), small settlement areas (SSA), and Hamlets (Barau et al., 2014). These three classes of settlement agglomerations are presented below:  

 Built-up areas (BUAs):  A built-up area (BUA) is generally an area of urbanisation with moderately-to-densely-spaced buildings and a visible grid of streets and blocks. BUAs are characterized as polygons that maintain a 100 m2 building density of 13 or more across an area greater than or equal to 0.4 km2.

Small Settlements (SSAs): A small settlement (SSA) is a settled area of permanently inhabited structures and compounds of roughly a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants. The housing pattern in SSAs is an assemblage of family compounds adjoining other similar habitations. SSAs areas are characterised as polygons containing 50 or more buildings and not a BUA.

 Hamlet  (HAMLET): A hamlet is a collection of several compounds or sleeping houses in isolation from small settlements or urban areas. Hamlets are characterised as polygons containing between 1 and 49 buildings.

BUAs are characterized as polygons that maintain a 100 m2 building density of 13 or more across an area greater than or equal to 0.4 km2.

Small Settlements (SSAs): A small settlement (SSA) is a settled area of permanently inhabited structures and compounds of roughly a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants. The housing pattern in SSAs is an assemblage of family compounds adjoining other similar habitations. SSAs areas are characterised as polygons containing 50 or more buildings and not a BUA.

 Hamlet  (HAMLET): A hamlet is a collection of several compounds or sleeping houses in isolation from small settlements or urban areas. Hamlets are characterised as polygons containing between 1 and 49 buildings.

The 2001 census in Ukraine was subject to severe undercount in all oblasts — with an average undercount of 10.5%. This undercount was more severe in large urban areas (e.g. Kyiv City, Kharkiv, Sevastopol and Dnipropetrovsk). No sex differential was observed in the 2001 census undercount. Raw census data have been adjusted for undercount in the census, along with updated birth and death registration data, prior to the projection of the population forward from 2001 to 2020. The census undercount was concentrated in the age group 0-4 years and ranged from 7% in Transcarpathia to 15% in Sevastopol and Kharkiv and 16% in Kyiv. 

UNFPA has assessed population age-/sex-specific projections against available household survey data (namely the 2014 Household Budget Survey, 2012 MICS Survey, 2007 DHS Survey and 2009-2014 Labor Force Survey). These ADM-1 population projections are consistent with the fertility and mortality trends documented in the available survey data. The vital registration data and ADM-1 population projections for 2020 do not exhibit any notable age heaping.

Birth and death registration in Ukraine is mandatory. The vital registration system in Ukraine between 2001 and 2020 appears to have been well-maintained. The birth and death registration data is approximately complete in Ukraine for this time period in areas that have been under effective control of the government of Ukraine. Since 2014, the completeness and quality of vital event registration in Donetsk and Luhansk has detioriated.

A limitation of the vital registration data in Ukraine is that these data are published by place of registration, not by place of occurrence (and place of registration). As a result, the 2020 population projections using 2001 census data and 2001-2019 vital registration data implicitly assume that there is negligible difference between the place where births and deaths occur and where they are registered. While this is likely true in most urban areas of Ukraine, it is unlikely for the more rural areas of Ukraine where people seek health care (both reproductive care, emergency care and chronic disease care) in urban areas. As a result, this COD-PS is likely to under-estimate the older age population size in rural areas of Ukraine and over estimate the young age population size in urban areas. 

This COD-PS assumes that internal migration between oblasts and international migration after the 2001 census are accurately reflected in administrative data on migration flows maintained by the State Statistics Service of Ukraine. Further refinement of the COD-PS is likely needed to account for recent migration movements related to armed conflict. So, where possible, this COD-PS dataset should be integrated with available data on migration stocks and flows from UNHCR, IOM, and other sources.",baseline population | common operational dataset - cod,csv | xlsx

In all 16 of the 17 of the ADM-1 areas, population size was projected to decline mainly due to negative natural change. For more detailed information, refer to the Eurostat Population Estimates Database and its accopmanying documentation here - https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Population_projections_at_regional_level#:~:text=Two%20out%20of%20three%20EU,a%20smaller%20population%20in%202050.&text=The%20median%20age%20of%20population,to%2049.1%20years%20in%202050.",,common operational dataset - cod,csv | xlsx

This COD-PS is constructed directly from post-censal population estimates from the 2021 Population, Housing and Dwelling Census of Slovakia. The 2021 census was the first 100% electronic census and the first integrated census (combination of data obtained from administrative sources and data obtained from the population). It was conducted as a ""de jure"" census. For the population census, the information was collected either through the census website (scitanie.sk) or via a mobile app (SODB2021) which was available both on Android and iOS. The census form was available in 8 languages (Slovak, Hungarian, Romani, Russian, Ukrainian, English, German, French) and came in two types.
The ""Type A"" form allowed respondents to register by birth number or identity card or residence permit. The census form only collected data that could not be obtained in the required quality from existing administrative sources, so there were fewer questions compared to previous censuses, thus reducing the administrative burden on the population.
The ""Type B"" form allowed respondents to register by date of birth and sex, as it was primarily intended for residents who do not have an assigned personal identification number in Slovakia. The type B census contained more questions (20 questions) than the type A form (14 questions), as it is not possible to use administrative data sources for residents without a birth or registration number.

 Built-up areas (BUAs):  A built-up area (BUA) is generally an area of urbanisation with moderately-to-densely-spaced buildings and a visible grid of streets and blocks. BUAs are characterized as polygons that maintain a 100 m2 building density of 13 or more across an area greater than or equal to 0.4 km2.

Small Settlements (SSAs): A small settlement (SSA) is a settled area of permanently inhabited structures and compounds of roughly a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants. The housing pattern in SSAs is an assemblage of family compounds adjoining other similar habitations. SSAs areas are characterised as polygons containing 50 or more buildings and not a BUA.

 Hamlet  (HAMLET): A hamlet is a collection of several compounds or sleeping houses in isolation from small settlements or urban areas. Hamlets are characterised as polygons containing between 1 and 49 buildings.
