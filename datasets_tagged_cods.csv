This data is provided in an effort to promote the use of geospatial science and applications for sustainable development and resource conservation in the developing world. Digital elevation models (DEM) for the entire globe, covering all of the countries of the world, are available for download on this site.

The SRTM 90m DEMs have a resolution of 90m at the equator, and are provided in mosaiced 5 deg x 5 deg tiles for easy download and use. All are produced from a seamless dataset to allow easy mosaicing. These are available in both ArcInfo ASCII and GeoTiff format to facilitate their ease of use in a variety of image processing and GIS applications. Data can be downloaded using a browser or accessed directly from the ftp site. If you find this digital elevation data useful, please let us know atÂ [csi@cgiar.org](mailto:csi@cgiar.org).

The NASA Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) has provided digital elevation data (DEMs) for over 80% of the globe. This data is currently distributed free of charge by USGS and is available for download from the National Map Seamless Data Distribution System, or the USGS ftp site. The SRTM data is available as 3 arc second (approx. 90m resolution) DEMs. A 1 arc second data product was also produced, but is not available for all countries. The vertical error of the DEMâ€™s is reported to be less than 16m. The data currently being distributed by NASA/USGS (finished product) contains â€œno-dataâ€ holes where water or heavy shadow prevented the quantification of elevation. These are generally small holes, which nevertheless render the data less useful, especially in fields of hydrological modeling.

original DEMs were further processed to fill in these no-data voids. This involved the production of vector contours and points, and the re-interpolation of these derived contours back into a raster DEM. These interpolated DEM values are then used to fill in the original no-data holes within the SRTM data. These processes were implemented using Arc/Info and an AML script. The DEM files have been mosaiced into a seamless near-global coverage (up to 60 degrees north and south), and are available for download as 5 degree x 5 degree tiles, in geographic coordinate system â€“ WGS84 datum. These files are available for download in both Arc-Info ASCII format, and as GeoTiff, for easy use in most GIS and Remote Sensing software appications. In addition, a binary Data Mask file is available for download, allowing users to identify the areas within each DEM which has been interpolated.

With this village update the SIGCAF dataset was compared to a village dataset available from World Resources Institute, 2013 ([http://www.wri.org/resources/maps/forest-atlas-central-african-republic](http://www.wri.org/resources/maps/forest-atlas-central-african-republic)).

1. Elininate all villages with the same geo-location and the same name, autmatically with the ""Find Duplicates"" option in the ArcToolb

2. Manual check, commune by commune for duplciate villages between the two datasets.

3. Generated new pcodes, keeping the old pcode for consistency, and using the pcodes of region, prefecture, sub-prefecture, commune.

4. Updates from the field added

These eight- or nine-digit codes begin with one or two digits that correspond to the quarters (administrative level 1 features) and then seven digits with no discernible significance.

Castries features have ‘1’, ‘2’, or ‘3’ prefixes that form non-geographically contiguous groups. As the names and significance of these groups are unknown, the Castries features were given a common and nationally distinct ‘13’ prefix in the OCHA P-code system. To preserve the ‘1’, ‘2’, and ‘3’ designations, to provide a distinct formulation for all of Castries features, and to maintain the source settlement codes the OHCA P-code system comprises the national code (‘LC’), the new prefixes (‘4’ to ‘13’) and the original settlement codes (padded to nine digits).

The source dataset had two administrative level 2 features, ‘Petit Piton’ and ‘Ti Delcer’ in Soufriere quarter with the same ‘settlement code’ (60720000). These have been given the distinct P-codes LC06060720001 and LC06060720002 respectively.

Some other sources (such as www.citypopulation.de) distinguish the ‘Central Forest Reserve’ (LC11110450000) as a distinct quarter but this is not supported by its settlement code.

Most administrative level 2 (district) features contain one or more complete zones de santé (health zones), thus enabling summation of the contained zone de santé populations.  For instance, the 2019 population for ‘Matadi’ (CD2001) is summed from the populations of zone de santé Matadi (zone de santé code CD2001ZS01) and Nzanza (CD2001ZS02).

However, the following 25 small urban level 2 features are contained in larger level 2 features that are not distinctly represented by a zones de santé.  The “cod_admpop_adm2” tab of the population spreadsheet indicates zero populations for those features and the table below identifies the level 2 feature that includes the missing population.  (Three level 2 features include the missing population from two features each.)

This situation has no impact on the administrative level 1 (province) tables as every zone de santé lies completely in a level 1 feature.

Administrative level 1:  11 regional states (kililoch, singular kilil ) and two chartered cities (astedader akababiwoch, singular astedader akababi ), - Addis Ababa [ET14] and Dire Dawa [ET15].

Administrative level 2:  92 zones

Administrative level 3:  1,084 woredas (see caveats)

The 2022 population estimate is based on the 2021 Central Statistics Agency (CSA) projection at administrative level 3 and CSA’s town populations.  For the newly split woredas, which are mainly towns upgraded to woredas, the CSA town population is adjusted according to the parent woreda’s population.  For woredas in the HNO 2022 administrative list, having no population data estimate in either CSA 2021 projection of woreda or towns, the 2021 HNO estimate is used.

For newly created woredas, in the absence of estimates in the 2021 CSA projection of woreda population or town population, and the absence of information on the HNO2021 estimates, appropriate average populations are used from the parent woreda population (e.g., Arda Jila woreda in Oromiya region; Tulefa town, Gashena town, Tulu Awila and Adagn Ager Chaqo in Amharta region).  The final population estimate is then adjusted against the new CSA 2021 total projections at administrative level 1.

The new CSA 2021 population estimate includes disaggregation by sex, which is considered in this estimation. However, for urban and rural population estimates, as there is no such estimation in the newly CSA 2021 projection, the 2017 CSA projection proportion is applied at administrative level 3. Similarly, the age breakdown is estimated based on the CSA 2016 Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey (HCES) available at administrative level 1.

The age groups from CSA 2016 HCES include the age groups 0-9 and 15-19 years.  To support humanitarian needs analysis and response planning for specific children age groups, the age group 0-9 has been split into two (0-4 and 5-9) and the 15-19 age group has been split into two (15-17 and 18-19) using the Federal Ministry of Health's estimated population distribution for the particular age groups.

Finally, the estimated values were rounded to whole integers and therefore introduce minute difference in totals for the consolidated administrative level 2, 1, and 0 tables.  (The maximum national deviation for total population is 6.)
","Two administrative level 3 units are not represented in the COD-AB because of their contested boundaries:  Dawe Serer [ET041199] in Oromia region and Quarsadula [ET050905] in Somali region.   These features are included in the 'eth_gazetteer_20201102.xlsx' but excluded from the reference ITOS 'ETH_AdminBoundaries_TabularData.xlsx' gazetteer.

Source: The dataset was compiled from three sources:

- DIVA: U.S. National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA) database of foreign geographic feature names as of in June 2012 - 12,215 locations.
- DTM (Displacement Tracking Matrix) master lists of IDP and returnee locations as of April 2020 - 2,054 locations.
- OSM (Open Street Maps) - 23,541 locations.

Method:
1)	Datasets were merged and duplicate locations were identified and excluded based on spatial proximity and common name attributes. The final dataset consisted of 12,494 locations. 
2)	An ArcGIS spatial join routine was used to attribute locations with the administrative boundary names and place codes for governorates, districts, and sub-districts. Attributes were also applied for the administrative centers of governorates and districts. 
3)	The population density (people per hectare) at each location was extracted from the WorldPop 2020 estimate (grid format) using the Extract by Points routine in ArcGIS (point overlay). https://www.worldpop.org/doi/10.5258/SOTON/WP00117","- This dataset is to be used for humanitarian purposes only.
- It is intended to be a gazetteer for geographical reference and should not be used as a cartographic source or as an authoritative reference list. 
- The dataset does NOT contain any designations of hierarchy (e.g. governorate or district capitals), and as such, the placenames may refer to a variety of place type, including city, town, village or neighbourhood.
- The population density is a qualitative measure only, which is not to be used to quantify the population of size of a location.
-P-codes are derived from the administrative level 0-3 structure.  If, in the future, administrative level 4 boundaries are obtained, these P-codes may need to be re-generated.",geodata | hxl | populated places-settlements,xlsx | shp | xlsx

The GRID3 Angola settlement extents are then classified (based on building density) into three classes: built-up areas (BUA), small settlement areas (SSA), and Hamlets (Barau et al., 2014). These three classes of settlement agglomerations are presented below:  

Built-up areas (BUAs):  A built-up area (BUA) is generally an area of urbanisation with moderately-to-densely-spaced buildings and a visible grid of streets and blocks. BUAs are characterized as polygons that maintain a 100 m2 building density of 13 or more across an area greater than or equal to 0.4 km2.

Small Settlements (SSAs): A small settlement (SSA) is a settled area of permanently inhabited structures and compounds of roughly a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants. The housing pattern in SSAs is an assemblage of family compounds adjoining other similar habitations. SSAs areas are characterised as polygons containing 50 or more buildings and not a BUA.

Hamlet  (HAMLET): A hamlet is a collection of several compounds or sleeping houses in isolation from small settlements or urban areas. Hamlets are characterised as polygons containing between 1 and 49 buildings.

The GRID3 Angola settlement extents are then classified (based on building density) into three classes: built-up areas (BUA), small settlement areas (SSA), and Hamlets (Barau et al., 2014). These three classes of settlement agglomerations are presented below:  

 Built-up areas (BUAs):  A built-up area (BUA) is generally an area of urbanisation with moderately-to-densely-spaced buildings and a visible grid of streets and blocks. BUAs are characterized as polygons that maintain a 100 m2 building density of 13 or more across an area greater than or equal to 0.4 km2.

Small Settlements (SSAs): A small settlement (SSA) is a settled area of permanently inhabited structures and compounds of roughly a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants. The housing pattern in SSAs is an assemblage of family compounds adjoining other similar habitations. SSAs areas are characterised as polygons containing 50 or more buildings and not a BUA.

 Hamlet  (HAMLET): A hamlet is a collection of several compounds or sleeping houses in isolation from small settlements or urban areas. Hamlets are characterised as polygons containing between 1 and 49 buildings.

The GRID3 Lesotho settlement extents are then classified (based on building density) into three classes: built-up areas (BUA), small settlement areas (SSA), and Hamlets (Barau et al., 2014). These three classes of settlement agglomerations are presented below:  

 Built-up areas (BUAs):  A built-up area (BUA) is generally an area of urbanisation with moderately-to-densely-spaced buildings and a visible grid of streets and blocks. BUAs are characterized as polygons that maintain a 100 m2 building density of 13 or more across an area greater than or equal to 0.4 km2.

Small Settlements (SSAs): A small settlement (SSA) is a settled area of permanently inhabited structures and compounds of roughly a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants. The housing pattern in SSAs is an assemblage of family compounds adjoining other similar habitations. SSAs areas are characterised as polygons containing 50 or more buildings and not a BUA.

 Hamlet  (HAMLET): A hamlet is a collection of several compounds or sleeping houses in isolation from small settlements or urban areas. Hamlets are characterised as polygons containing between 1 and 49 buildings.

 Built-up areas (BUAs):  A built-up area (BUA) is generally an area of urbanisation with moderately-to-densely-spaced buildings and a visible grid of streets and blocks. BUAs are characterized as polygons that maintain a 100 m2 building density of 13 or more across an area greater than or equal to 0.4 km2.

Small Settlements (SSAs): A small settlement (SSA) is a settled area of permanently inhabited structures and compounds of roughly a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants. The housing pattern in SSAs is an assemblage of family compounds adjoining other similar habitations. SSAs areas are characterised as polygons containing 50 or more buildings and not a BUA.

 Hamlet  (HAMLET): A hamlet is a collection of several compounds or sleeping houses in isolation from small settlements or urban areas. Hamlets are characterised as polygons containing between 1 and 49 buildings.

Both the settlements’ extents and classification are derived solely from Ecopia’s building footprints. Data analysis and processing were achieved entirely using Esri’s ArcGIS software (Pro version 2.7.3), it’s native module arcpy, and open source python library pandas 1.3.0.

The GRID3 Senegal settlement extents are then classified (based on building density) into three classes: built-up areas (BUA), small settlement areas (SSA), and Hamlets (Barau et al., 2014). These three classes of settlement agglomerations are presented below:  

 Built-up areas (BUAs):  A built-up area (BUA) is generally an area of urbanisation with moderately-to-densely-spaced buildings and a visible grid of streets and blocks. BUAs are characterized as polygons that maintain a 100 m2 building density of 13 or more across an area greater than or equal to 0.4 km2.

Small Settlements (SSAs): A small settlement (SSA) is a settled area of permanently inhabited structures and compounds of roughly a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants. The housing pattern in SSAs is an assemblage of family compounds adjoining other similar habitations. SSAs areas are characterised as polygons containing 50 or more buildings and not a BUA.

 Hamlet  (HAMLET): A hamlet is a collection of several compounds or sleeping houses in isolation from small settlements or urban areas. Hamlets are characterised as polygons containing between 1 and 49 buildings.

The MoES published these administrative boundaries online and made publicly available.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for Caucasus and Central Asia with support from OCHA FIS cleaned the administrative level 3 dataset, integrated P-codes according to the State Classification of Administrative and Territorial Units (COATE) of the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018, names in 3 languages (English, Kyrgyz, Russian) and place types.  Twelve independent cities (from the same source but a different dataset) were added to the administrative level 3 dataset to ensure it fully corresponds to the COATE. 

ITOS live services will be added at a later date.

The Kyrgyz administrative boundary system does not designate administrative level 3 (community) features outside administrative level urban areas although those areas are characterized by rural type.  This administrative level 3 shapefile and KMZ file includes ‘expanded’ units with special P-code suffixes which characterize the features according to an OCHA developed coding system.  For instance, the Forestry in Uzgen district (KG06255000000) has a Pcode of KG06255000901. 

Some source polygons were indicated as ‘Unknown’ and are designated as such in the gazetteer.

The gazetteer contains the standard administrative level 3 table and an 'expanded' administrative level 3 table.

The ‘expanded’ administrative level 3 P-code suffix system is described below:
ADM3_PCODE suffix	ADM3Type_EN	ADM3Type_RU	ADM3Type_KY

The administrative level 2 (district) shapefile and KMZ file contain 'placeholder' polygons corresponding to the administrative level 1 independent city features that the Kyrgyz administrative boundary system does not recognize at administrative level 2.

Similarly the administrative level 3 (community) shapefile and KMZ file contains 'placeholder' polygons for the  administrative level 1 and administrative level 2 features that the Kyrgyz administrative boundary system does not recognize at administrative level 3.","Community Users should be aware that 277 Admin3 names are blank.

•	Added new Catumbela Municipality in Benguela Province

•	Added new Cacula Municipality in Huila Province

•	Merged municipalities into new Luanda Municipality (there are fewer municipalities in the new data set as Ingombota, Kilamba Kiaxi Maianga, Rangel and Sambizanga have been merged to create the new Luanda municipality, as per Census 2014 data and maps).

The COD-AB consolidates the following sub-metropolitan areas found in this COD-PS dataset:

""KMA-Bantama"", ""KMA-Manhyia"", ""KMA-Manhyia South"", ""KMA-Nhyiaeso"", and ""KMA-Subin"" are consolidated into ""Kumasi Metropolitan"" [GH0228]
""CCMA-Cape Coast North"" and ""CCMA-Cape Coast South"" are consolidated into Coast Metropolitan [GH0511]

""STMA-Essikado-Ketan"", ""STMA-Sekondi"", and ""STMA-Takoradi"" are consolidated into ""Sekondi Takoradi Metropolis"" [GH1508]

The COD-AB excludes Guan district (census population 28,238) which was created in 2021 from Hohoe district [GH1410].  However, although Hohoe district is in Volta region [GH14], Guan was made a part of an enlarged Oti region [GH10].  

The gha_admpop_2022.xlsx spreadsheet and associated .csv files handle the above discrepancies in the folllowing manner:

1)  The spreadsheet includes the following tabs:

The complete census population data is found in the 'gha_admpop_adm2PS_2022' tab (272 data records) including the following fields:
'ADM2_PCODE' from the COD-AB, containing duplicates in the case of consolidations detailed above;
'ADM2_EN_PS' containing the census source district names;
'ADM2_EN' containing the corresponding COD-AB district name field with duplicates for the metropolitain consolidations names detailed above above and 'Hohoe' instead of 'Guan'.
This table is not represented by a .csv file.

2)  The census population data aligned to the COD-AB administrative level 2 layer is found in the 'gha_admpop_adm2_2022' tab (260 data records).   This table is also represented in the 'gha_admpop_adm2_2022.csv' file.

3)  The census population data aligned to the COD-AB administrative level 1 layer is found in the 'gha_admpop_adm1_2022' tab (16 data records).  This table assigns the population of Guan district to the Oti region record even though Guan district was created from the Volta region.  In this way the Oti and Volta polygons may be mapped with their census populations although the COD-AB is thought to have become slightly incorrect.  This table is also represented in the 'gha_admpop_adm1_2022.csv' file.

The 'gha_admpop_adm0_2022' tab and 'gha_admpop_adm0_2022.csv' file are not influenced by these caveats.

This COD-PS is constructed directly from post-censal population estimates from the 2021 Population, Housing and Dwelling Census of Slovakia. The 2021 census was the first 100% electronic census and the first integrated census (combination of data obtained from administrative sources and data obtained from the population). It was conducted as a ""de jure"" census. For the population census, the information was collected either through the census website (scitanie.sk) or via a mobile app (SODB2021) which was available both on Android and iOS. The census form was available in 8 languages (Slovak, Hungarian, Romani, Russian, Ukrainian, English, German, French) and came in two types.
The ""Type A"" form allowed respondents to register by birth number or identity card or residence permit. The census form only collected data that could not be obtained in the required quality from existing administrative sources, so there were fewer questions compared to previous censuses, thus reducing the administrative burden on the population.
The ""Type B"" form allowed respondents to register by date of birth and sex, as it was primarily intended for residents who do not have an assigned personal identification number in Slovakia. The type B census contained more questions (20 questions) than the type A form (14 questions), as it is not possible to use administrative data sources for residents without a birth or registration number.
