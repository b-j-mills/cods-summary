The 2024 Common Operational Dataset on Population Statistics (COD-PS) update for Ukraine presents raion-level (ADM-2), oblast-level (ADM-1) and national-level (ADM-0) estimates of population size by sex and standard 5-year demographic age groups. The 2024 COD-PS update revises the 2023 COD-PS update and 2022 COD-PS update produced by UNFPA, by accounting for recent population change due to mobility, mortality and fertility dynamics.

This COD-PS update was prepared by the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA. This update was prepared in consultation with the Humanitarian Country Team and UN Country Team in Ukraine, as well as national partners including the Institute for Demography and Quality of Life Problems, Ukraine and the State Statistics Service of Ukraine.

The 2024 COD-PS update, like all COD-PS updates, is strictly a humanitarian data product of the United Nations aligned to the ""best available humanitarian data standard"". It does not represent or, in any way, replace official statistics or official population projections of the Government of Ukraine and it is not intended to meet the international standards of official statistics.

The Ukraine Common Operational Dataset on Population Statistics (COD-PS) 2024 is a restricted dataset, in line with applicable national laws and the host country agreement with the United Nations. It is shared only with the Ukraine Humanitarian Country Team, UN Country Team in Ukraine, and the Government of Ukraine.",,,,
